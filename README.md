## Text Classification (From BagOfWords To Transformers) [GitHub LINK](https://github.com/EngMuhammadAtef/Text-Classification-From-BagOfWords-To-Transformers)

It only takes one toxic comment to sour an online discussion. The Conversation AI team, a research initiative founded by Jigsaw and Google, builds technology to protect voices in conversation. A main area of focus is machine learning models that can identify toxicity in online conversations, where toxicity is defined as anything rude, disrespectful or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion.

**In this Notebook I will start with the very Basics of NLP and Build all the way to latest deep learning architectures, It will cover the Following:**
- Simple BagOfWords Machine Learning Model (Benchmark)
- RNN
- LSTM/GRU
- BI-Directional LSTM
- Transformers - Attention is all you need
